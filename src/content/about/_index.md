#### Professional Perception 2023

I've embraced the field of web development during the last six months, creating solutions and learning about a wide range of technologies. In addition, I've developed a strong interest in Docker and have built custom self-hosted solutions for it. My area of play? Using a Proxmox system, I can test, break, fix, and gain knowledge.

#### GOlang why? idk

I'm currently writing Go (or Golang) codes, which go beyond the codes and containers. I always use it for a lot of projects because of its power and simplicity. My expertise lies in DevOps infrastructure, where I use tools like Ansible to manage lightweight Kubernetes clusters using k3s.
